=====================

v2.2.1
----------------
Date: 2011-05-18

David K. <support@klarna.com>
    Klarna.php (summarizeGoodsList)
        New method that can be used to get a aggregated price for the entire
        goodslist

    Klarna.php (reserveAmount)
        Replace the simple goodslist summary that did not take taxes and
        discounts into consideration with a call to summarizeGoodsList

v2.2.0
----------------
Date: 2011-05-15

Rickard D. <support@klarna.com>
    Klarna.php (assembleAddress) :
        Only validate that the proper object type is sent in to Klarna, no longer
        performs any validation of the content of the fields.

    klarnaaddr.php () :
        Removed validation of field contets. Now possible to set all fields to
        empty strings if you want.

    Klarna.php (addTransaction, reserveAmount, activateReservation) :
        If $gender is sent in as an empty string, treat it as null.

    klarnacalc.php (calc_apr) :
        Removed the ability to send in a FIXED or SPECIAL pclass to
        KlarnaCalc->calc_apr. If this function is called with a FIXED or SPECIAL
        pclass it will now throw an exception instead of causing a fatal error.

    Klarna.php (getAllPClasses) : added
    storage.intf.php (getAllPClasses) : added
        Added possibility to get all stored pclasses, regardless of eid or type.

    Klarna.php (setPCStorage) :
        Added possibility to set a PCStorage on the Klarna object.

    Klarna.php (getPCStorage) : made public (was protected)
        Added possibility to get the configured PCStorage object from the Klarna
        object.

    Country.php (getLanguageForCountry, getCurrencyForCountry) : added
        Added possibility to get the language or currency for a specific country.

    All Files () :
        Updated code to follow the PEAR standard.

        Refactored several classes into their own files.
            All refactored classes were previosly declared inside the Klarna.php
            file. The new files are now instead included in the Klarna.php file,
            so no functionality has changed in that regard.
                KlarnaCountry   => Country.php
                KlarnaCurrency  => Currency.php
                KlarnaEncoding  => Encoding.php
                KlarnaException => Exceptions.php
                KlarnaFlags     => Flags.php
                KlarnaLanguage  => Language.php


        Made almost all exceptions thrown more specific and meaningful than just
        KlarnaException, although they still extend KlarnaException so old
        try-catch blocks will still work.
