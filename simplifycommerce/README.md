This plugin adds Simplify Commerce as a payment option on your PrestaShop checkout page.

## Installation
1. If you haven't done so already, download a release (simplifycommerce.zip) from the menu option above and install the zip file through the PrestaShop admin panel and enable it.

2. Configure the module by adding your API keys on the settings page (Click the 'Configure' link on the module)

Optionally:

1. Unzip the downloaded source zip file and build your own module zip file by executing an 'ant' command within the root directory.

2. You can install the newly built module (located in the 'dist' folder) as before.
