		<h2 id="EbayHelpPart2">The PrestaShop eBay module</h2>

		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart2-1">1) "Parameters" tab</h3>
		<p>
		This section should be configured when using the module for the first time. You should set your PayPal account as a payment method for products on eBay by providing the email address that you use for your PayPal account.  <br/>
		You should set the delivery method and charges which will be applied to your products on eBay.
		</p>


		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart2-2">2) "Category settings" tab</h3>
		<p>
			Before listing your products on eBay, you should link the product categories from your Prestashop shop with those from eBay. You can also choose to sell the products from your Prestashop shop at a different price on eBay. This effect on the price is set as a percentage or an absolute value.<br/><br/>



		</p>
		<br />

		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart2-3">3) "Template manager" tab</h3>
		<p>To optimise the design of your product information on eBay, you can personalise the header and the footer of your listings by creating a template which is applied to all of your products on eBay. By giving your listings your own style (logo, colours, etc.), you will become more well-known and more attractive as a seller on eBay. A template which is well-thought out and presented in a professional and attractive manner will often make a big difference to buyers. </p>
		<br />

		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart2-4">4) "eBay Sync" tab</h3>
		<p>This section allows you to list your products on eBay. You can list all products from your Prestashop shop on eBay (recommended) or only products from certain categories.</p>

		<h2 id="EbayHelpPart3">Tips for successful selling on eBay</h2>

		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart3-1">Provide good product details</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>1.	A good title </strong> (field limited to 80 characters)<br/>
				means more buyers viewing your listing and your item selling for the best price. Your listing's title is your headline for the item you're selling and an opportunity to excite buyers. Imagine you're the buyer - what would make you click on the listing? Get creative, and get results.
				<ul>
					<li>State exactly what the item is (even if it repeats the category name).</li>
					<li>Include details such as the brand, product name, size or artist. </li>
					<li>Imagine you are the buyer when you create the title and description for your listing. What would you want to know about the item? </li>
					<li>Consider adding a subtitle for more description that'll be seen in searches.</li>
					<li> Use descriptive keywords to clearly and accurately convey what you are selling. You can use up to 80 characters. You don’t have to use all 80 characters. </li>
					<li>Include the item's brand name, artist, or designer. </li>
					<li>Include item-specifics. For example, include size, colour and condition. </li>
					<li>State exactly what your item is, even if your title repeats the category </li>
					<li>Don’t use multiple synonyms or plurals. It’s not needed for search and may make your title less attractive to buyers. </li>
					<li>Omit punctuation marks and asterisks.</li>
					<li>Don't include 'wow' or 'look'. Buyers don't search for words like these. </li>
					<li>Use correct spelling, but don't worry about creating a grammatically correct sentence.  Don't overuse acronyms. Don't use all caps – in the online world this is seen as shouting and is more likely to put off potential buyers.</li>
				</ul>

			</li>
			<li><strong>2.	A good description </strong><br />Think of your listing as advertising - an opportunity to inform and get buyers excited about your products. Buyers rely on the details in your listing description to make their purchase decision, so it's important that all of the information you include is accurate, clear, and comprehensive. Imagine you're the buyer - what would you want to know?</li>
			<li><strong>3.	Clear photos </strong><br />Using lots of high-quality pictures provides a great shopping experience and helps to sell your items. It’s free to add up to 12 photos to each listing on eBay. You need to add at least one photo with the longest side at least 500 pixel.</li>
			<li><strong>4.	Price and postage costs </strong><br />try to keep these in line with what is available on eBay. Free postage will get you better visibility. </li>
		</ul>
		<br />

		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart3-2">Maintain a good seller profile.</h3>
		<p>eBay rewards sellers who provide the best quality service with better visibility in Best Match searches and fee discounts. Buyers are prompted to provide feedback and detailed seller ratings following a transaction. These scores are used to generate your seller performance standard.  </p>
		<p>It is your responsibility to meet the seller performance standards required by eBay. Try to focus your customer service on the following criteria:
</p>
		<ul>
			<li><u>Item as described :</u></li>
			<li><u>Communication :</u> promptly answering buyer questions</li>
			<li><u>Dispatch time :</u> keep an eye on stock levels</li>
			<li><u>Postage and packaging :</u>free delivery will give you an automatic 5 star rating.</li>
		</ul>
