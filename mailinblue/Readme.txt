Mailin's PrestaShop module allows you to easily sync your PrestaShop customers with your Mailin lists. 
This module facilitates you to synchronize your list of customers to your Mailin mailing lists and vice versa. 
It also allows you to use Mailin SMTP service to route your emails with Mailin. 
In addition, the module also comes with a tracking code using which you will be able to track all orders your customer
